# Personal-Site

This is my first attempt at a personal website to display my portfolio and available skills.
I build this using HTML5, CSS, and vanilla JS.

The portfolio page displays each project on mobile and desktop using a mockup website.

The chatbot is an API plugin from Drift, where you can manage your messaging and profile on their website.
